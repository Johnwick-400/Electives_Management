# Electives Management

## Project Overview

The "Electives Management" project aims to simplify the process of choosing elective subjects for students in engineering or other degree programs. Traditionally, colleges and universities rely on a lot of paperwork and manual processes for elective selection, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming for both students and administration.

To address this issue, we have developed a web application that allows college administrators to manage elective subjects in a digital, user-friendly manner. Students can access the web application to view available elective subjects, select their preferences, and submit their choices electronically. This eliminates the need for paper-based forms and streamlines the entire elective selection process.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system for students and administrators.
- **Elective Subject Management:** Admins can add, edit, and remove elective subjects from the system.
- **Student Dashboard:** Students can view available elective subjects, select their preferences, and submit their choices.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can manage elective subjects, view student selections, and generate reports.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
